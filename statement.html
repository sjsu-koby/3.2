      I made this game in honor of my first and oldest dog, Kandy, the chihuahua.<br>
      The game's inspiration came from the dinosaur game that you could play<br>
      offline on the Google browser. "Jumping Dog" will serve as a memory when<br>
      Kandy passes away and as the first ever game I made through code.

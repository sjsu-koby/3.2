# Jumping-Dog
Overview:

From the current point I'm at, 3.1, I want to remove the flappy bird clouds from the moving ones to provide a sense of movement. I also want to give the dog an animation to give even more movement. I will add a start screen and fix the end screen when the player dies so that it looks like you're frozen rather than floating across during death. I want the dog to be walking on the ground rather than flying in the air. I also want to change the pipes to something park-like for a dog to jump over.
